CW Skimmer Google Map Plotter
-----------------------------

I wanted way to plot all callsigns on a google map, similar to the
way RBN plots them.  Unfortunately for RBN it only allows plotting of
calls calling CQ.  I wanted all calls since many DX were answering and
not calling CQ but were being decoded.  The map gives me a quick way
to view my reception propagation.

History:
--------

The idea was leveraged from the dump1090 release off github.  

    https://github.com/antirez/dump1090.git

Dump1090 was written by Salvatore Sanfilippo antirez@gmail.com and 
is released under the BSD three clause license. 

Basically just leveraged the gmap.html file.


Usage:
------

./plotter.sh <QRZ Login> <QRZ Password> <Path to Skimmer Spots.txt> [<# calls to list>]

By default, will list 100 calls.  

*** Note ***

Currently you need a QRZ.com login to utilize this plotter since it performs 
DB queries via XML.  You should be able to run w/o subscription, but ideally
I'd track the failed login and not perform future queries and just rely on
hits in the cache file.  That's the idea for the cache, to reduce queries to
QRZ.com.  The cache represents CW users, so we really don't need the full
QRZ.com DB.

To exit, just ^C and should kill the three processes and remove tmp files.


To access the map:
