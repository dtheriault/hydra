#  Configuration file for rtl_hpsdr
#

## Global options

## sound_dev: alsa audio device to play to.
## Default is none (no audio)
#
# sound_dev default
#sound_dev plughw:0,0


## ip_addr: ip address
## Default is 192.168.1.1
#
ip_addr 192.168.1.1

## total_num_rcvrs: the total number of rcvrs you want to activate.
## That could be less than the number installed.
## Default is whatever gets detected (and less than MAX_RCVRS)
#
#total_num_rcvrs 1

## rcvr_order: use this to rearrange the order of the RTL dongles.
## The numbers are 1 based. For example, if you have 7 RTL dongles
## attached and dongle 6 & 7 are the only ones you want to use,
## set the total_num_rcvrs to 2 and rcvr_order 6,7
## Default is how they are detected by rtl-sdr starting at 1.
#
# rcvr_order 6,7,1

## signal_multiplier: use this value to scale the noise floor
## to perhaps get a better panascope view in the client program.
## Default is 1
#
signal_multiplier 50

## Per RTL receiver options

## For different values, comma separate them per RTL.
## The last value entered is used for the rest of detected rcvrs.
## i.e. if you have 5 RTL devices enter gain like:
## -53,10,-22,0,-10
## or
## -53,-22,0  which is the same as -53,-22,0,0,0
## -53,0  which is the same as -53,0,0,0,0
## -53  which is the same as -53,-53,-53,-53,-53

#                                     445, 480, 496 };

## tuner_gain: gain in tenths of a dB, -30 means -3.0 dB.
## Default is 0. Note that a value of 0 will enable
## auto gain for that RTL.
#
tuner_gain 100

## agc_mode: enable/disable automatic gain
## Default is 0 or disabled.
#
agc_mode 1

## direct_mode: enable/disable direct sampling for the RTL2832U
## Default is 0 or not direct.
#
direct_mode 0

## freq_offset: offset in hz to be added to frequency to be set.
## This would be if you were using an upconverter with an LO of
## say 125000000 Hz, or the client program had a range under
## what you wanted to receive.
## Default is 0
