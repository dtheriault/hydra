Description:  I2C Support Scripts
---------------------------------

Directory contains the simple scripts to allow programming of the TI CDCE949
PLL used for the Hydra prototype. 

Files:

pllinit.sh -- Script to program the PLL for 8 channels, 9th being Mixer

dumpregs.sh - Script to read all the PLL registers and display them

pllregs.txt - Text file for register programming values.  Format is simple
              <offset> <value>


Notes:

Register values were generated using the TI Clock Builder utility.  To gen
new clock rates for the project, re-run the tool for new values and then 
update the pllregs.txt file.  Re-Run the pllinit.sh script once with new vals.

You only need to run the init script once as the register values are stored
in the PLL's flash and are restored on power up.  

Rebooting the oDroid C1 does not reset the PLL (currently, would like to do
this in future).
